Project Title: 🛰️ Spaceship Titanic – Predictive Machine Learning Model

Description:
In this project, I explored the Spaceship Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which challenges us to predict whether a passenger was transported to another dimension after the spaceship disaster. Using Python, Machine Learning, and AI-driven techniques, I built a predictive pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Key highlights:

📊 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering – handled missing values, created meaningful features (like grouped family IDs, cabin sections, and spending patterns).

🤖 Machine Learning Models – applied algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, and tuned hyperparameters for best performance.

🔮 Predictive Insights – the model achieved strong accuracy in predicting passenger outcomes, showcasing how AI can be leveraged for real-world classification problems.

📈 Evaluation Metrics – compared models using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices to ensure robustness.

Tools & Skills Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), AI/ML concepts, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Gradient Boosting, Hyperparameter Tuning.

👉 This project not only sharpened my data science and ML modeling skills but also demonstrated the importance of AI-driven predictive analytics in solving complex problems.
